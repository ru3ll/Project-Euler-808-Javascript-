# Project-Euler-808-Javascript-
An attempt to solve problem #808 on project euler using js


## Thoughts
After running the code for about two hours i realised that all these occurrences take place on numbers upto those that start with a 3 and then the next occurrence skips all the other numbers till the next power of ten. I guess this is why the program takes so long... ðŸ˜’

anyway... still wanna complete it
